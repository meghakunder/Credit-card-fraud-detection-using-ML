# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-ML
Assignment during Online Internship with DLithe(www.dlithe.com)

Project Idea

Companies that involve a lot of transactions with the use of cards need to find anomalies in the system. The project aims to build a fraud detection model on credit cards.We will use the transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud to detect if new transactions made from the customer are fraud or not.

The dataset is available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud"><b>here</b></a>

I have used Random Forest Algorithm to find the important features in the dataset. I found results from both Random Forest and DecisionTree, to compare them. Main task was to find the frauds in the dataset. The dataset contains 492 cases of fraud.

I have created a blog that explains the steps:https://meghakunder.github.io/
